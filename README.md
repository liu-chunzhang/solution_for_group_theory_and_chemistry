## Introduction of this textbook

In my opinion, this book clearly introduces the fundamental application of finite group representation theory in chemistry and is an excellent textbook.

在我看来，本书在有限群表示论在化学中的基础应用介绍清楚，是一本优秀的教材。

However, I felt that it is not easy to solve the after-class questions completely, when I solved them independently. So I specially compiled a copy for future reference by myself and others.

但其课后题完整解决难度并不小，我在自己独立解决它们时深感如此。所以我特地整理一份，以备日后自己和其他人查阅参考。
